## Technology Used
-   Mongoose
-   MongoDB
-   JavaScript
-   Bash
-   Node
-   JSON

## Process
I began the project by understanding how the frontend should look, then started with the server creation and making the `Patient Resource` and `routes`. I created the necessary curl scripts, and after creating the proper backend server with everything essential, I moved on to the front end.

## Future Resolutions
In addition to what I have completed, other essential resources that can be added are the patients' symptoms, various states and possible stats that can be updated within those states, and seeing the probability of testing positive given the symptoms.
